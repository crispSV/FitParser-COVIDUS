# FitParser-COVIDUS
A .fit file python script for COVIDUS personal health assistant. Garmin fitness computers export their data to ANT/GARMIN .fit files. These files are binary encoded. This script makes use of python-fitparse Library from  https://github.com/dtcooper/python-fitparse to decode and import GARMIN generated health data to COVIDUS platform.
# Fit Files
* FIT files contain data stored in a binary file format.
* The FIT (Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer) file protocol is specified by ANT.
* The SDK, code examples, and detailed documentation can be found in the ANT FIT SDK.
